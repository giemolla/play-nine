## Play Nine

### Math skills kids' game built with React.js

Game rules are very simple: you have to choose the right number based on the random amount of stars or a couple of numbers which sum up to the right number. The goal is to use all of the given numbers (every one can be used only once). All the functionality is  based on Pluralsight Course 'React.js: Getting Started'.

Bootstrap 4 and fonts from FontAwesome are used to style the layout.

The functionality I added myself is timer - 30 seconds to finish the game.
